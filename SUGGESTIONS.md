- Create a .env file per environment containing the differents endpoints which the app will be feeded

- Add Lint to the project for code quality

- Add Prettier for a better formatting

- Create a component to handle the Test Reports header, for example: "Test Reports > Execution #10"

- Instead of using "../../../utils/Images" at the moment we want to import any image/ icon, It'd be better to implement it in the ts.config by adding "@ images/", "@utils/" and so on.
